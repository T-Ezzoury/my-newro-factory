# Admin Routes Documentation

## Overview
This document provides information about the admin routes for chapters, questions, and answers in the application.

## Current Status
The routes for chapters, questions, and answers have been configured to temporarily redirect to the admin page. However, the actual components for these routes have not been created yet.

## Required Components
To fully implement the CRUD operations for chapters, questions, and answers, the following components need to be created:

### Chapter Components
- `ChapterListComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/chapter/chapter-list/`
- `ChapterFormComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/chapter/chapter-form/`
- `ChapterDetailComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/chapter/chapter-detail/`

### Question Components
- `QuestionListComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/question/question-list/`
- `QuestionFormComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/question/question-form/`
- `QuestionDetailComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/question/question-detail/`

### Answer Components
- `AnswerListComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/answer/answer-list/`
- `AnswerFormComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/answer/answer-form/`
- `AnswerDetailComponent` in `src/app/pages/admin/answer/answer-detail/`

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the component directories and files following the pattern used in the `intern` and `promotion` directories.
2. Implement the components using the corresponding services (`ChapterService`, `QuestionService`, `AnswerService`).
3. Uncomment the routes in the respective route files (`chapter.routes.ts`, `question.routes.ts`, `answer.routes.ts`).

## Testing
A test component has been created at `src/app/test-admin-routes.ts` that can be used to verify that the routes are working correctly. This component uses the Angular Router to navigate to each route and logs the results.
